The problem was solved by carefully inspecting the CSS specificity of the conflicting styles. It turned out that a globally applied style with higher specificity was overriding the Tailwind classes in the problematic sections. To fix this, I added !important flag to my Tailwind classes to ensure that they override other conflicting styles.  Additionally, I reviewed my class names for any typos or inconsistencies. Thoroughly checking for typos and inspecting browser developer tools for conflicting CSS rules is crucial for debugging similar issues.
