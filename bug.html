I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  The HTML structure seemed fine, and the Tailwind configuration appeared to be set up correctly. I tried various solutions like restarting the development server, clearing the browser cache and hard-refreshing, but the problem persisted. The issue only manifested in certain parts of the application, while other parts using similar classes rendered correctly.
